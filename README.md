# ScreenLess

COVID-19 is one of the biggest crises in the history of humanity.

Millions of people go to fast-food restaurants every day.
They use touchscreens for ordering food.
This can be quite dangerous.

Everyone has access to their phone's assistant (Siri, Google Assistant...)
We found a way to navigate any platform using this service.

We enhanced our solution to prevent food waste and to encourage people to reduce carbon footprint.

That's why I created SCREENLESS
