# Sprint Review

## Group XII

### Goals for this week:
For this week we have worked on the server and the client and the connection between them.
As there was said before, we have made a plan to split the tasks of server and client seperately
to improve teamwork and to deliver faster.  The progress has been made pretty good and we hope to
provide a good quality demo

## Good things from this week.
 1)The progress of the server has been done faster than expected. Now from this point we can add more
  details to the server and improve the server so that it can store data in a file or a database.
 2)The progress of the client is also great. The GUI is still in progress, but so far we have the needs
 of the client to connect with the server.
 3)There is already a small connection between server and client, which is perfect because this is also
 one of the things we need for our demo. 
 4)We have improved with other things like:
 -keeping up with our weekly reports.
 -making good use of gitlab.
 -testing the code.


## What we can do better. 
 1)There are still some things which are a little mess in gitlab. Too many branches were used and it was
 our second week, so it's pretty understandable that we should improve working with gitlab and its functionalities.
 2)The other trouble we had was that we started working with sockets, while we were expected to do differently (to
 use a web API for the connection between server and client). But now that we know that,we can improve working with 
 this method.
 3)The last things that we need to work on is to make use of checkstyle for all the code we have and to make use of 
 Continuous Integration.
