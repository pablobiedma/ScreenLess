# Sprint Review

## Group XII

### Goals for this week:
For this week we have worked on the server and the client and the connection between them.
We also focused in finishing everything before the demo.

## Good things from this week.
 1) We finished everything on time.
 2) We were on time to the meetings.
 3) All the goals from the sprint plan were accomplished.


## What we can do better. 
 1) We can focus on the important things instead of doing less relevant tasks.
 2) We can also distribute smaller and most precise tasks instead of more general ones.
