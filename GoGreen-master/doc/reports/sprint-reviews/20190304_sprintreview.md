#### **Sprint review**

#### -Goal for this week
For this week we had 2 main goals, implement a database so we can store information and work on the client, making it more modular and add some GUI related things.

#### -The good things of this week:
1) The base of the GUI of our application is done, we have a menu with the features we want to implement
2) The master branch is now an organized branch where everything works and is easy to understand.
4) We have improved with other things like:
   -keeping up with our weekly reports.
   -making good use of gitlab.


#### -The things we can do better for our project:
1) Working on the connection with the database. It was one of our main goals last week but we didn't implement it yet. We should do it in the beginning of this week so we can work on the user-login and add features to out application.
2) Cleary hand out tasks to everyone so everyone knows what he needs to do and when it has to be finished.
