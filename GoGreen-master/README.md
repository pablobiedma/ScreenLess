#### **G** - Goal
* The main goal for me in this project is to work together with my team so that I can obtain more experience for projects in the future.
* But I also want to learn things for my teammates, so that I can pass the knowledge to other teammates when working on other projects in the future.
* Finally as last goal I want to show my teammates my working skills, so I hope to surprise them with this project.


#### **R** - Reality
* In reality we have less people working on this project,which is not what I expected, but I have a feeling that with less people we can communicate better with eachother, so that would be better for our project.


#### **O** - Options
* We have the opportunity to divide and conquer:we can split the tasks and each teammate can come up with a plan on how we can fix these tasks.


#### **W** - Will
* I am willing to work with everything I've got on this project, because I think this is the best way to motivate others to work at their best.

#### **G** - Goal
* To improve my programming skills personally but also learn how to code in cooperation with teammembers.
* This is important for a lot of things I might do after studying. You cannot everything alone, in most of the cases you need teammembers to accomplish something.
* When I know that I can start a similar project without a problem, and understand all the principles of our own program I know I achieved my goal.


#### **R** - Reality
* At the moment I'm busy with studying so there is enough room for improvement when it comes to programming skills, I hope to learn that through this project and a lot of research I will do on my own.


#### **O** - Options
* In this project there is a lot of freedom to learn new things, but there are also a lot of things I never saw before and have to learn, this will take a lot of time but I'm looking forward to learn new things and get our application up and running.


#### **W** - Will
* I will do my best to learn as much as possible and look for all the information I need to go on with the tasks I have to do. I will be doing this the whole quarter starting right now. Right now I will start with reading information about how to start a java project and how to use Git. I will try and do my best to help teammates when it is possible, I will share my problems and tips with them to create a great application.

#### **G** - Goal
* Main goal of course is to enhance my programming skills and working on something I have not encountered before and doing the proper research
* To experience and get better at working with a team on  a project so later on I am prepared for the next similar challenge in my life.
* This is important for me because by achieving this goal I will be able to share work with others organise a team and make plans for what everyone should be doing at a certain point in time


#### **R** - Reality
* Both of those things that I mentioned as my goals could use improvement even though I am a team player I am sure there is room for improvement and for my programming skills as well


#### **O** - Options
* This course is the perfect option to achieve these goals


#### **W** - Will
* I have always been a motivated person and always trying to reach my goals which in my opinion is very important also I am looking forward to working in this team and I hope that we can all help each other in achieving our goals as a group and as individuals as well

#### **G** - Goal
* The main goal for me in this project is to end up helping society by creating this app, cooperating and using our knowledge.
* However, an impact in society is not the only important goal for me, I also want to have an impact in my teammates, helping them in order to by more productive and also in myself by learning from them.
* Finally another goal would be not to have a worse performance as a group due to the lack of 2 members since the beginning.


#### **R** - Reality
* As I said before, we are less people than expected, and we may not have the best programming skills, however, since the first time I meet this group I believe that we can do something special.


#### **O** - Options
* This course is such a great opportunity to: improve society, improve ourselves and improve our teammates. We should use this opportunity to make the most of it.


#### **W** - Will
* My intention is to spend as much time as possible if neccessary in order to make this work given that we have such a cool and important opportunity.
